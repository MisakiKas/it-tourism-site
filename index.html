            <h2>Explore the Historical Marvel of A Famosa</h2>
            <p>Discover the rich history and heritage of Malacca through the iconic fortress, A Famosa.</p>
            <p>A Famosa is one of Malaysia's most iconic historical landmarks. Located in Malacca, this fortress was built by the Portuguese in the 16th century and remains a symbol of Malaysiaâ€™s colonial past.</p>
            <p>Originally constructed in 1511, A Famosa served as a stronghold for the Portuguese, and later fell into the hands of the Dutch and British. Today, only the famous Porta de Santiago gate remains standing, offering a glimpse into the rich history of Malacca.</p>
            <p>Visitors can explore the ruins, learn about the site's historical significance, and enjoy the surrounding attractions, including St. Paul's Church and the Malacca River.</p>
